## Security Hacker
- A security hacker is someone who explores methods for breaching defenses and exploiting weaknesses in a computer system or network


## Tor (Network)
- Tor, short for The Onion Router, is free and open-source software for enabling anonymous communication. 
- It directs Internet traffic through a free, worldwide, volunteer overlay network, consisting of more than seven thousand relays, to conceal a user's location and usage from anyone performing network surveillance or traffic analysis. 
- Using Tor makes it more difficult to trace a user's Internet activity. 
- Tor's intended use is to protect the personal privacy of its users, as well as their freedom and ability to communicate confidentially through IP address anonymity using Tor exit nodes.
### Nodes
1. #### Tor Exit Nodes
A Tor exit node is the last Tor node that traffic passes through in the Tor network before exiting onto the internet.
2. #### Tor Gaurd Nodes
A Tor guard node is the point of entry into the Tor network.
3. #### Tor Bridge Nodes
A Tor bridge node is a specific type of Tor guard node that is not listed on the public directory of Tor nodes.


## Onion Routing Protocol
- Onion routing is a technique for anonymous communication over a computer network. 
- In an onion network, messages are encapsulated in layers of encryption, analogous to layers of an onion.


## Cyber Security Engineer
Cybersecurity engineers, sometimes called information security engineers, identify threats and vulnerabilities in systems and software, then apply their skills to developing and implementing high-tech solutions to defend against hacking, malware and ransomware, insider threats and all types of cybercrime.


## Log File
A log file is a computer-generated data file that contains information about usage patterns, activities, and operations within an operating system, application, server or another device, and is the primary data source for network observability.


## RUDY Attack
- R.U.D.Y. is a popular low and slow attack tool that is designed to crash a web server by submitting long form fields. 
- The attack is executed via a DoS tool which browses the target website and detects embedded web forms.


## DoS
- A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is an attack meant to shut down a machine or network, making it inaccessible to its intended users. 
- DoS attacks accomplish this by flooding the target with traffic, or sending it information that triggers a crash.


## Gnome
- GNOME, originally an acronym for GNU Network Object Model Environment, is a free and open-source desktop environment for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. 
- It's intended to make a Linux operating system easy to use for non-programmers and generally corresponds to the Windows desktop interface and its most common set of applications. 
- GNOME allows the user to select one of several desktop appearances.


## DDoS Attack
- DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) is a category of malicious cyber-attacks that hackers or cybercriminals employ in order to make an online service, network resource or host machine unavailable to its intended users on the Internet. 
- A DoS attack is characterized by using a single computer to launch the attack. 
- A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a type of DoS attack that comes from many distributed sources, such as a botnet DDoS attack.


## DNS
- The Domain Name System is the hierarchical and decentralized naming system used to identify computers reachable through the Internet or other Internet Protocol networks. 
- The resource records contained in the DNS associate domain names with other forms of information.


## Load Balancing
Load balancing refers to efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across a group of backend servers, also known as a server farm or server pool.


## Rootkit
- A rootkit is a malicious software bundle designed to give unauthorized access to a computer or other software. 
- Rootkits are hard to detect and can conceal their presence within an infected system. 
- Hackers use rootkit malware to remotely access your computer, manipulate it, and steal data.


## Single point of failure
- A single point of failure is a part of a system that, if it fails, will stop the entire system from working. 
- SPOFs are undesirable in any system with a goal of high availability or reliability, be it a business practice, software application, or other industrial system.


## ArcadeNetwork
ArcadeNetwork is the world's first decentralised platform providing cross metaverse asset interoperability and true ownership to the Gamers.


## Brute-force Attack
- In cryptography, a brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly. 
- The attacker systematically checks all possible passwords and passphrases until the correct one is found.


## Malware
- Malware is intrusive software that is designed to damage and destroy computers and computer systems. 
- Malware is a contraction for “malicious software.” 
- Examples of common malware includes viruses, worms, Trojan viruses, spyware, adware, and ransomware.
